"""
Provides GraphQL support via the ``graphql-language-service-cli`` npm package
(https://github.com/graphql/graphql-language-service), whose ``graphql-lsp`` binary
implements the Language Server Protocol.

The server resolves schema/operation relationships through graphql-config: it looks
for a ``.graphqlrc.yml`` / ``graphql.config.{yml,yaml,json,js,ts}`` (or a ``graphql``
key in ``package.json``) at the workspace root to learn where the schema and the
GraphQL documents live.

Caveats:
    * ``graphql-language-service-cli`` declares ``graphql`` as a *peer* dependency, so we
      install both packages into the managed directory.
    * A usable graphql-config file at the workspace root is *required*, not merely helpful
      for cross-file navigation: ``graphql-language-service-server`` never sets its internal
      "initialized" flag without one, and every request handler (documentSymbol, hover,
      definition, completion, workspaceSymbol) short-circuits to an empty result while that
      flag is unset -- including document symbols for a single, self-contained file. Only
      syntax highlighting (which Serena does not use) keeps working in that case. The
      server logs "graphql-config error, only highlighting is enabled" when this happens;
      we detect that message to fail fast instead of waiting out the full startup timeout.
    * That same "graphql-config error" line is also logged in a much milder situation: the
      config loaded and the caches came up, but the schema it points at does not fully
      resolve (e.g. it uses a directive that the server declares programmatically and that
      is never declared in SDL). Requests are served normally then -- document symbols come
      back -- while the schema-backed features are degraded. The server does not distinguish
      the two cases in its message, so we branch on whether the caches ever initialized.
    * Language is registered as experimental.
