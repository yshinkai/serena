        Finds symbols and code entities (classes, methods, etc.) based on the given name path pattern.
        The returned symbol information can be used for edits or further queries.
        Specify `depth > 0` to also retrieve children/descendants (e.g., methods of a class).

        A name path is a path in the symbol tree *within a source file*.
        For example, the method `my_method` defined in class `MyClass` would have the name path `MyClass/my_method`.
        If a symbol is overloaded (e.g., in Java), a 0-based index is appended (e.g. "MyClass/my_method[0]") to
        uniquely identify it.

        To search for a symbol, you provide a name path pattern that is used to match against name paths.
        It can be
         * a simple name (e.g. "method"), which will match any symbol with that name
         * a relative path like "class/method", which will match any symbol with that name path suffix
         * an absolute name path "/class/method" (absolute name path), which requires an exact match of the full name path within the source file.
        Append an index `[i]` to match a specific overload only, e.g. "MyClass/my_method[1]".

        :param name_path_pattern: the name path matching pattern (see above)
        :param depth: depth up to which descendants shall be retrieved (e.g. use 1 to also retrieve immediate children;
            for the case where the symbol is a class, this will return its methods).
            Ignored if `include_body=True`. Default 0.
        :param relative_path: (optional) restrict search to this file or directory. If None, searches entire codebase.
            If a directory is passed, the search will be restricted to the files in that directory.
            If a file is passed, the search will be restricted to that file.
        :param include_body: whether to include the symbol's source code. Use judiciously.
        :param include_info: whether to include additional info (hover-like, typically including docstring and signature),
            about the symbol (ignored if include_body is True). Info is never included for child symbols.
            Note: Depending on the language, this can be slow (e.g., C/C++).
        :param include_kinds: (optional) limits results to the given LSP symbol kinds (integers)
        :param exclude_kinds: (optional) list of LSP symbol kinds (integers) to exclude.
        :param substring_matching: If True, use substring matching for the last element of the pattern, such that
            "Foo/get" would match "Foo/getValue" and "Foo/getData".
        :param max_matches: maximum number of permitted matches. If exceeded, a shortened result is returned
             which allows refining the search. -1 (default) means no limit. Set to 1 if you search for a single symbol.
