        Replaces occurrences of a pattern across multiple files in ONE call.

        This is the preferred tool for repeated small edits (renames, import swaps, annotation changes,
        path prefixes) spanning several files or many places in one file: one call with a SHORT pattern
        replaces many single-file replacements with long disambiguating needles.

        Recommended protocol whenever there is ANY risk of unintended replacements:
        1. Call with dry_run=True: every prospective change is returned as a minimal line diff with an
           occurrence id; nothing is modified.
        2. Call again with dry_run=False, passing the ids you want in occurrence_ids (omit it to apply
           all). You pick the desired replacements from the list - no counting, no needle-crafting.

        For clearly unambiguous bulk replacements you may skip the dry run; pass expected_count as a
        guard. If the actual number of matches differs, NOTHING is changed and the diff list is
        returned, so a failed guard costs one call and gives you the dry-run output to select from.

        :param needle: the string (mode "literal") or regular expression (mode "regex"; Python `re`
            syntax with DOTALL and MULTILINE) to search for
        :param repl: the replacement string. In regex mode, backreferences to matched groups can be
            specified as $!1, $!2, etc.
        :param mode: either "literal" or "regex", specifying how `needle` is to be interpreted
        :param relative_path: only consider this file or directory (default: the whole project)
        :param paths_include_glob: optional glob (relative to the project root, e.g. "src/**/*.java")

        :param paths_exclude_glob: optional glob of files to exclude; takes precedence over the include glob
        :param dry_run: if True, do not modify anything; return the prospective changes as a list of
            diffs with occurrence ids
        :param occurrence_ids: optional list of occurrence ids (obtained from a dry run) to which the
            replacement is restricted; if any id is unknown or stale, NOTHING is changed. If omitted,
            all occurrences are replaced.
        :param expected_count: optional guard for calls without occurrence_ids: the number of
            occurrences you expect to be replaced. If the actual count differs, nothing is changed and
            the list of prospective changes is returned. -1 disables the guard.
        :param max_answer_chars: if the output exceeds this many characters, a shortened version is
            returned. -1 uses the configured default.
