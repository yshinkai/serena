"""
Regression test for a workspace with no graphql-config file at all.

``graphql-language-service-server`` never sets its internal "initialized" flag when it
cannot find a graphql-config (.graphqlrc.yml / graphql.config.*) at the workspace root --
it only logs a "graphql-config error, only highlighting is enabled" warning and stays
uninitialized forever. Before this fix, Serena wouldn't recognize that message and would
always wait out the full 30s startup timeout, then continue to silently return empty
results (document symbols, hover, etc.) for the lifetime of the server. This test asserts
that startup instead fails fast once that warning is observed.
