"""Regression tests for clojure-lsp project-wide indexing.

Bug: ``find_referencing_symbols`` (and the underlying ``request_references``)
returns incomplete cross-file results unless the referencing files have already
been opened/indexed during the current session via ``find_symbol`` /
``get_symbols_overview``. The result is deterministically partial — it grows as
more files happen to get indexed by side-effect — which silently biases call
graphs towards files the user has already explored.

The tests here use a fresh module-scoped language server and probe a symbol
whose references live in a file (``extra.clj``) that no other test in this
module touches. The references must be returned even though no prior tool call
has caused the file to be opened in the LSP.
