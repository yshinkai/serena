"""
Diagnostics smoke test for the HTML language server.

``vscode-html-language-server`` does not validate HTML structure itself — upstream
``vscode-html-languageservice`` only forwards validation to embedded sub-services
(CSS/JS in ``<style>`` / ``<script>`` blocks), and those aren't wired up in
standalone mode. So a malformed-HTML fixture would yield zero diagnostics regardless.

Asserting "at least one diagnostic" would be a false positive waiting to happen.
Instead, this test verifies the diagnostics endpoint is reachable end-to-end and
the framework's pull→publish fallback handles the empty response correctly — i.e.
it returns a list, not an error. That alone catches LS-crash regressions on the
diagnostic request, which is the practical purpose for this LS.
