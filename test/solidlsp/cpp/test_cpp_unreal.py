"""
Unreal Engine 5 fixture tests for the clangd language server.

UE game code is written against a macro-based reflection layer (UCLASS, UFUNCTION,
UPROPERTY, GENERATED_BODY) and engine container types (TArray, TMap). These tests
verify that the clangd backend resolves symbols, references, definitions, and
rename edits in the hand-written sources under Source/, and never in the
UnrealHeaderTool-style generated files under Intermediate/ (which contain the
same identifiers, as real generated reflection code does).

The fixture's stub engine headers mirror UE 5.7's ObjectMacros.h: annotation
macros are empty in real UE compilation too (only UnrealHeaderTool parses them).

The fixture lives in its own repository directory (ue_test_repo) served by
clangd only: ccls 0.20240202, the build shipped by Ubuntu and Homebrew, crashes
intermittently when its session covers the stub engine headers, and clangd is
the supported backend for Unreal Engine projects (see the setup guide).
