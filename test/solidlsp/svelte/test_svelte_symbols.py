"""Agent-level symbol discovery/navigation for plain .ts files of a svelte-only project.

Reproduces https://github.com/oraios/serena/issues/1552: in ``languages: [svelte]`` mode,
document-symbol requests for .ts/.js files were answered by the base svelte LS (which only
serves .svelte files) instead of being routed to the companion, svelte-plugin-aware TS server.
As a consequence, symbols defined in plain .ts files were undiscoverable through ``find_symbol``/
``get_symbols_overview``, and ``find_referencing_symbols`` failed with ``No symbol matching ...``
because it must first locate the target symbol via ``documentSymbol``.

These tests exercise the high-level :class:`LanguageServerSymbolRetriever` that backs those agent
tools, complementing the lower-level checks in ``test_svelte_basic.py``.
