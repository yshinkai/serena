# Unreleased (main)

Status of the `main` branch. Changes prior to the next official version change will appear here.

* General:
  - Fix: MCP `initialize` now reports Serena's version instead of the installed mcp SDK version (#1889)
  - Fix: Parallel agents auto-registering projects could overwrite each other's changes to the global
    project list in `serena_config.yml`
  - Fix: `TextUtils.insert_text_at_position` returned a wrong position when the inserted text merged
    with an adjacent character into a single newline sequence (e.g. a `\n` inserted directly after an
    existing `\r`); the position is now determined from the resulting text
  - Fix: process-tree cleanup signaled descendant language-server processes without waiting for them,
    which could leave grandchildren as zombies; cleanup now waits for the discovered descendants (#1464)
  - Fix: `read_only` restriction in project definition was not applied to base tool set when in single-project context (#1938)

* Memories:
  - Fix: `save_memory`/`edit_memory` wrote directly to the memory file with `open(path, "w")`, which
    truncates it before the new content is written; a crash, OOM kill, or full disk partway through
    the write could destroy the previous, valid content instead of just losing the update. Both now
    write through a temp-file-plus-`os.replace` helper, matching the approach `save_yaml()` already
    uses for settings files (#1958)

* JetBrains:
  - Fix: Concurrent Serena sessions activating different projects at the same time with
    `jetbrains_launch_command` set would each independently launch the IDE, racing each other for
    the IDE's own config-directory lock; JetBrains IDE launches are now serialized per launch
    command and Serena waits for the plugin server to become reachable before proceeding (#1864)

* Hooks:
  - Fix: Codex's documented hook wiring only routes `remind` through `PreToolUse` on `Bash`, so its
    reset-on-Serena-tool-use branch was unreachable there and reminder counters never cleared after a
    successful Serena call. Add a `serena-hooks reset` command and a `PostToolUse` example matched to
    Serena's own tools to close the gap (#1852)

* Language Servers:
  - Add FreeBSD mapping to platform detection
  - Remove unnecessary platform checks from the following language servers, expanding the set of
    supported platforms accordingly: Elixir Tools, Intelephense, Perl, TypeScript, VTS
  - Fix: the managed Solidity language server could report no diagnostics on macOS when Hardhat could not write
    its global state under ``~/Library``; Serena now gives the child process an isolated home-directory view
    via ``solidity_state_dir`` without changing the parent process's ``HOME`` (#1817)
  - Add Fatou support as an alternative Julia language server (`julia_fatou`)
  - Fix: Nextflow's `_flush_deferred_workspace_scan` marked the workspace scan flushed even when both
    of its `completion` probes failed, permanently skipping the flush (and silencing retries) for the
    rest of the session (#1871)
  - Fix: Exceptions raised during `LanguageServerManager.start` did not stop the language server subprocess if it was
    already started (#1949)
  - Fix: Dart's `$/analyzerStatus` notifications were logged as unhandled-method warnings during analysis (#1855)
  - Fix: `DartLanguageServer._start_server` discarded both `$/analyzerStatus` and
    `experimental/serverStatus`, the two notifications the Dart analysis server sends to report
    indexing progress, and returned as soon as `initialized` was sent instead of waiting for either
    one; a request issued right after activation (`find_symbol`, `find_referencing_symbols`) could
    return before the workspace scan finished. Serena now waits (bounded by 60s) for either signal to
    report completion, matching the pattern already used for pyright, basedpyright and rust-analyzer
  - Fix: clojure-lsp was not told that Serena sends `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`, so changes made
    outside Serena's own edit tools (a git checkout, another editor, a build step) need not invalidate
    its analysis; symbol queries could then answer from a stale index, e.g. `find_symbol` returning a
    body from the position the symbol used to occupy (#1593)
  - Fix: Scala cross-file queries waited a fixed 5s after the first file was opened, which on a cold
    Metals is long before its build import, indexing and compilation have finished; the first
    `find_referencing_symbols` of a session could return a fraction of the references with nothing to
    indicate it was incomplete. Serena now declares work-done progress support and waits for the work
    Metals reports, bounded by the new `indexing_timeout`, `indexing_start_grace` and
    `indexing_quiet_period` settings
  - Fix: a `tsserver` crash mid-indexing (e.g. a V8 heap OOM) sent the same `$/progress` "end"
    event as a normal completion, so `find_referencing_symbols` and other cross-file queries
    silently returned an empty result instead of surfacing the crash. The crash is now detected
    independently via the `window/logMessage` notification tsserver already sends, and the
    affected wait now raises instead of reporting success (#1814)
  - Fix: two Serena instances activating the same project concurrently launched their Kotlin LSP
    processes against the same on-disk index storage location, so the second instance's requests
    were repeatedly cancelled by the first instance's server. A Kotlin LSP process now claims that
    storage directory via a lock; a single instance (including across restarts) still gets the
    same directory, and a second concurrent instance gets a directory of its own instead of
    contending for the first one's (#1966)
  - Fix: document symbol caching did not account for language-server-specific post-processing of
    symbols, which was applied outside the caches; the processing of language servers that post-process
    symbols (e.g. Go, Nix, Fortran, F#, Vue) was therefore repeated on every request or, if it mutated
    symbols in place, re-applied to already processed cached results

CLI:
  - Fix `project index-file` command not using only the relevant language server to index the given file (#1965)

* Dependencies:
  - Remove the redundant `dotenv` dependency; the `dotenv` module is provided by `python-dotenv`

# v1.7.0 (2026-08-09)

* General:
  - Fix: Race conditions in ProjectServer when used by multiple clients in parallel   
  - Fix: `GitignoreParser` interpolated a directory's name unescaped into gitignore pattern position;
    a directory named with pattern metacharacters (e.g. a stray `***`) could turn a scoped pattern
    into one matching far more than intended, silently excluding most or all of the project from
    indexing #1806
  - Fix: cleanup of an independently-started LSP process and its children required enumerating the
    system process table (`psutil`), which can be denied even for processes Serena owns in a
    sandboxed environment; cleanup now signals the known process group directly (#1818)
  - Fix: the README, the Language Support docs page and the project template omitted several already-supported language servers
  - Fix: a tool call exceeding the timeout blocked the task executor indefinitely; the executor now
    recovers without user-induced cancellation
  - Add Grok Build support (context `grok`, setup CLI, hooks)
  - The `languages` key in project configurations was changed to `language_servers` to better reflect
    the actual semantics (configurations are automatically migrated)
  - Fix: glob matching bare `*` and `?` in non-`**` patterns matched across `/`, contradicting documented behaviour #1732
  - Project activation errors are now reported to the client in Serena's system prompt, instead of failures 
    being visible only in the log. This applies both to a failed activation of an explicitly given project and to a 
    failed `--project-from-cwd` auto-detection (#1773).
  - Enclose sub-prompts in XML-like tags to make scopes explicit
  - Prompts and prompt templates:
    - Allow initial project prompts and project-specific newly activated modes to use templating
    - Support function `embed_memory` in prompt templates to inline a memory's contents

* Security:
  - ProjectServer: Configure trusted hosts (local hosts only) when listening on localhost
  - SerenaDashboardTrayManager: Configure trusted hosts (local hosts only)
  - Use sandboxed environment for prompt templating, preventing attackers from using custom prompts to
    execute commands in an uncontrolled manner

* CLI:
  - Fix: `start-mcp-server` help text for `--project-from-cwd` falsely promised a fallback to the CWD, which was 
    removed in v1.0.0 #1773
  - Improve `project health-check`:
    - Fix: Process always exited with code 0, even when the check failed, so callers 
      (CI, scripts) could not act on its verdict; it now exits with code 1 on failure. A `find_symbol` 
      result without any matches is now reported as a failure rather than as a warning.
    - Disable symbol groupers, remove flawed pattern search test

* Tools:
  - `find_symbol`, `jet_brains_find_symbol`: Change tool description to improve tool search results in clients that load tools dynamically
  - `get_current_config`: Result now includes language server status #1782
  - More liberal handling of ignored paths in file access tools:
    - Tools that explicitly target a single file (`create_text_file`, `read_file`, `replace_content`) no longer 
      consider ignored paths in general, i.e. all files can be accessed. 
      When a path is explicitly accessed, we should not try to prevent it; the agent is assumed to have a good reason 
      for doing so.
    - Tools that traverse a subtree of the project (`list_dir`, `find_file`, `search_for_pattern`) now all have an 
      option `skip_ignored_files` (whether to skip ignored sub-paths).
      Note that if the base path is itself ignored, ignored paths cannot be considered.

* JetBrains:
  - `jet_brains_find_symbol`: Disallow wildcard-only search, delegating to overview tool if request is for file

* Language Servers: 
  - Add Gleam language server support (via the `gleam lsp` server bundled with the Gleam compiler)
  - Fix: GraphQL: without a graphql-config file (`.graphqlrc.yml` / `graphql.config.*`) at the workspace
    root, `graphql-language-service-server` never leaves its "config missing" state, so every request
    (document symbols, hover, definition, completion, workspace symbols) silently returns empty results
    for the lifetime of the server -- not just cross-file navigation, as previously documented. Startup
    used to always wait out the full 30s readiness timeout in this case; the corresponding warning is now
    recognized so startup fails fast and logs a clear, actionable message instead
  - Fix: GraphQL: the server logs the same "graphql-config error" line when a config *is* present but
    its schema fails to load (e.g. it uses a directive that is only declared programmatically and never
    in SDL). Serena reported that as "found no graphql-config ... will all return empty results", which
    was wrong on both counts: the config exists, the caches do come up and document symbols still work --
    only the schema-backed features (hover, definition, completion, workspace symbols) are degraded.
    The two cases are now told apart by whether the caches ever initialized, and each gets its own message
  - Fix: GraphQL: adding, editing or removing a graphql-config file didn't invalidate Serena's on-disk
    document symbols cache, since it is keyed only on each file's own content hash. A project that
    enabled the `graphql` language server before a graphql-config existed would keep getting empty
    document symbols/hover/definition results forever after the config was added, even across
    restarts, until an affected file's content happened to change. The cache now also fingerprints
    the resolved graphql-config file's content
  - Allow language server priorities to be configured in `serena_config.yml` (for auto-detection during 
    project creation) 
  - **Add support for Nextflow** (language server `nextflow`), using the official
    [Nextflow language server](https://github.com/nextflow-io/language-server); the JAR is downloaded
    automatically, a Java 17+ runtime is required
  - Add `python_basedpyright` as an alternative Python language server
  - Java/JDTLS: stop downloading and loading the unused IntelliCode completion-ranking bundle; the retired
    `intellicode_version`, `intellicode_xmx` and `intellicode_xms` settings remain accepted but are ignored #1821
  - Kotlin: update the managed Kotlin LSP from `261.13587.0` to `262.9593.0`, including support for the
    new platform-specific archive layout and Windows ARM64 builds
  - Add support for Wolfram Language via the official [WolframResearch LSPServer](https://github.com/WolframResearch/LSPServer) paclet.
    Requires Wolfram Mathematica 13.0+ or Wolfram Engine 12.1+. Set `WOLFRAM_PATH` environment variable or configure
    `ls_path` in `ls_specific_settings`. Supports .wl and .wls files with diagnostics, document symbols,
    within-file references, hover documentation, and formatting.
  - Nix/nixd: support custom `ls_path` launchers and external JSON settings through `config_path` #1737
  - Fix: Nix/nixd diagnostics now use published diagnostics instead of the unsupported
    `textDocument/diagnostic` request, which terminated nixd #1802
  - Fix: `get_diagnostics_for_file` crashed with `SolidLSPException` for any Ansible file with at least
    one lint finding, because `ansible-language-server` doesn't implement `textDocument/documentSymbol`
    and the request used to map diagnostics onto owning symbols just threw. `AnsibleLanguageServer` now
    overrides that request to return `None` directly, so diagnostics fall back to being grouped under
    the file-level path as already documented #1758
  - Fix: pull-diagnostics fallback in `request_text_document_diagnostics` no longer swallows
    `LanguageServerTerminatedException`, so a crash during a diagnostics pull triggers the existing
    language-server restart path instead of silently returning no diagnostics #1770
  - Fix: F#'s `module <Name>` declarations reported a `selectionRange` pointing at the `module`
    keyword instead of at `<Name>`, so looking up hover/references from a module symbol's position
    returned the keyword's own docs instead of the module's #925
  - Fix: Erlang functions could not be addressed by any tool taking an exact name path, because
    Erlang LS identifies them as `name/arity` and `/` separates name path components. The arity is
    now separated by `#` instead (e.g. `create_user#4`), so the reported name path round-trips and
    `find_referencing_symbols`/`replace_symbol_body`/`insert_after_symbol` work on Erlang
    functions #1797
  - Fix: `LSPFileBuffer`: a stale content hash could be returned if files are kept open 
    and file contents were not read before trying to retrieve the hash value  
  - Fix: Change semantics of file opening (`open_file`) in the language server from "open file (if not already open)"
    to "ensure that the language server has the (current) contents of the file" (by sending `textDocument/didOpen`
    or `textDocument/didChange`), as this is always the intention of calling the method.
    If files were kept open in the language server (which the Svelte and Vue language servers did),
    the language server was not necessarily informed about updated contents.
  - Add Deno support (experimental; language server `deno`, backed by the Deno CLI's built-in
    `deno lsp`). Understands Deno module resolution (`npm:` / `jsr:` / `https:` imports) and the
    `Deno.*` globals, which the plain TypeScript language server does not. Overlaps TypeScript on
    file extensions, so it is not auto-detected and must be selected explicitly; requires the
    `deno` CLI on PATH
  - Fix: `find_referencing_symbols` reported file-level containers for references located inside Go
    struct bodies, interface bodies and `const` groups; improve the logic for finding the nearest
    enclosing symbol, adding the helper function `SymbolKind.is_container` (which is now also
    applied to identify high-level symbols that should appear in symbol overiews).
  - Rust: reduce rust-analyzer memory usage and reload churn by disabling cache priming and Cargo autoreload while preserving diagnostics.
  - `typescript`: Fix: on large projects, the first `find_referencing_symbols`/`request_references` call
    could silently race tsserver's project load and return incomplete results, because the fixed 2s
    grace for tsserver to *start* reporting `$/progress` (distinct from the separate, already
    configurable `indexing_timeout` used to wait for it to *drain*) was hardcoded and not large enough
    for projects where the initial project-graph resolution itself takes longer than that. The grace
    is now `indexing_start_grace` (default 5.0s), configurable the same way as `indexing_timeout` and
    `server_ready_timeout` #1586
  - Fix: On Linux, a language server process spawned in its own session (the default) is no longer
    orphaned when Serena is killed without a chance to shut down cleanly (e.g. SIGKILL, OOM) #1490
  - Language servers and their dependency providers now go through the `subprocess_run` helper instead of
    calling `subprocess.run` directly (e.g. for installation processes), so all such subprocesses get 
    `stdin=DEVNULL` and can no longer interfere with the stdio MCP connection #1748
  - `scala`: Fix: Metals asks via `window/showMessageRequest` whether to import a workspace it has not
    seen before, and Serena had no handler, so the request failed with `MethodNotFound` and Metals gave
    up on the import ("Unexpected error initializing server"). No build server was ever connected and
    every cross-file query fell back to the presentation compiler, which sees one file at a time, unless
    the project happened to have been imported beforehand by another editor. The three prompts that lead
    to a build server are now answered; anything else is dismissed, including the choice between several
    build definitions in one workspace. `ls_specific_settings.scala.auto_import_build: false` opts out
  - `scala`: Fix: in a repository whose builds live below its root, Metals was given only the repository
    root as a workspace folder, and its own one-level search takes just the first build it finds — so in
    a monorepo all but one build were served with no build target, silently returning no cross-file
    references. The build roots are now detected and passed as workspace folders, one Metals service per
    build; `ls_specific_settings.scala.project_roots` and `project_root_scan_depth` override the
    detection #1766

* Dashboard:
  - Fix: Serena PyPI version check triggered by callback on main thread could delay agent startup #1774
  - Improvements in `tray_manager` interface mode:
    - Fix: on macOS, the `tray_manager` interface put an icon in the Dock and in the app switcher
      (should only use menu bar icon)
    - On Serena shutdown, message the tray manager before lengthy project shutdowns
    - Fix: When dead ports are detected (Serena instance gone), explicitly update the tray menu 
      immediately (may not update automatically)
  - Use `tray_manager` interface as new default on macOS

* Hooks:
  - Add `serena-hooks --client=grok`, including Grok-native PreToolUse allow/deny output.
  - Use `SessionEnd` for Codex 0.145.0+ cleanup hooks and document the known `Stop` compatibility issue affecting older Codex versions.
  - PreToolUse remind hook: coerce non-string shell command values instead of failing, and recognize
    `target_file`/`targetFile` file-path keys (shared payload parsing, applies to all hook clients).
  - Fix hook input parsing for clients that emit raw control characters in JSON string values #1743.


# v1.6.1 (2026-07-21)

* General:
  - Fix: `FileUtils.read_file`'s `charset_normalizer` fallback (used when a file cannot be decoded with
    the project's configured `encoding`) decoded the raw bytes directly and therefore skipped the
    universal-newline translation that the primary read path applies. CR characters from disk thus
    reached Serena's in-memory file contents, where the rest of the code assumes LF-normalized text and
    the `line_ending` setting is meant to be the single point of line-ending translation on write. The
    fallback now normalizes line endings to LF, consistently with the primary path.
  - Fix: a symbol whose LSP range ended exactly one line past EOF, at column 0 (the convention for
    a range covering whole lines through the end of the file), raised `IndexError` in
    `SymbolBody.get_text`. That one well-defined case is now corrected to end at the actual last
    line; any other out-of-range end position now raises `InvalidTextLocationError` instead,
    rather than guessing at a body that could be wrong #1498

* Language Servers:
  - Fix: Properly differentiate between raw and high-level symbol cache fingerprints, avoiding unnecessary
    invalidations of the raw cache when only the derived high-level representation changes
  - Fix: Language servers were not notified of external file system changes, causing some
    symbolic operations (such as `find_referencing_symbols`) to report stale information.
    An explicit file system polling mechanism is now used to detect changes prior to the affected
    tool executions.
  - Fix: Order of ignore patterns passed to language servers was not respected #1729 
  - Improve uv-based language server launch command compatibility: Use the more widely supported 
    `uv tool run` instead of `uv x` #1721
  - Java (JDT-LS): add `runtimes` to `ls_specific_settings.java`, a list of extra JRE/JDK entries
    (`name`, `path`, optional `default`/`sources`/`javadoc`) passed through to JDT-LS's
    `java.configuration.runtimes`. Fixes silently broken JDK type resolution (`java.lang.Object`
    and other JDK types reported as "cannot be resolved") for projects whose source/target level
    exceeds the bundled JDK 21 JRE JDT-LS registers by default; configured runtimes extend rather
    than replace that bundled default. #1478
  - `gopls`: Fix `replace_symbol_body` corrupting single `type`/`var`/`const` declarations by
    duplicating the leading keyword (e.g. `type Foo` becoming `type type Foo`). gopls reports the
    symbol range of such declarations starting at the identifier rather than the keyword (unlike
    `func` declarations); the range is now extended to include the keyword so the body and the
    replacement range stay consistent.
  - `typescript` / `typescript_vts`: No longer ignore directories named `coverage`. This was intended to skip
    coverage-report output, but matched by bare dirname and so also hid legitimate source directories named
    `coverage` (e.g. `src/routes/coverage/`) from symbol tools. Generated report dirs are already covered by
    gitignore. Fixes #1523.
  - Fix: Restore `erlang` support (broken since v1.6.0 due to an implementation error) 

* Tools:
  - Fix: `search_for_pattern` marked one line too many as matched whenever a match ended with a line
    break, because the match's exclusive end index was mapped to a line number directly and therefore
    resolved to the start of the following line. The line the match ends on is now determined correctly,
    which also keeps `context_lines_after` aligned.
  - `safe_delete`: Add heuristic to delete superfluous empty lines after a deletion
  - `search_for_pattern`: on overflow, the shortening chain now emits each match's first line (full when
    it fits, otherwise truncated with a trailing '...' and a note) before falling back to bare line
    numbers, so agents can pick the right match without re-reading files. #1640

* Language Servers:
  - PHP: treat `.phtml` files as PHP sources by default (all PHP language servers) #1710
  - PHP/Intelephense: expose `file_filter` via `ls_specific_settings["php"]`, so that additional
    extensions containing PHP sources (e.g. Drupal's `.module` / `.install` / `.inc` / `.theme`)
    become visible to the symbol tools and are indexed by the language server #1710
  - Fix: an LSP `ContentModified` (-32801) response was surfaced as a hard `SolidLSPException`
    instead of being retried, as the spec expects for requests a client declared it will reissue.
    `send_request` now retries such responses for methods declared via a server's
    `retryOnContentModified` capability; rust-analyzer declares `textDocument/hover`, fixing the
    flaky `test_find_symbol[rust_add_function]` on windows-latest. #1724

* JetBrains:
  - Allow external files from dependencies (specified via references like "<ext:FileUtil.class|472e0a13>") to be
    - read via `ReadFileTool` 
    - searched via `SearchForPatternTool`
    - used in `JetBrainsFindDeclarationTool`
    when using plugin version 2023.3.3+

* Dashboard:
  - The version display now indicates when a newer Serena version is available
  - Fix: the "Last Execution" panel stayed on "Loading..." forever when there was no logged execution
    (e.g. a fresh server / no tool run yet), because `loadLastExecution()` only rendered the panel when
    the backend returned a non-null execution; the empty state is now rendered via the existing
    `displayLastExecution(null)` path, mirroring the other panels #1713

* Dependencies:
  - Bump `mcp` from 1.27.0 to 1.28.1
  - Bump `anthropic` from 0.59.0 to 0.117.0

# v1.6.0 (2026-07-16)

* General:
  - Speed up MCP startup when auto-creating projects at startup (e.g. using `--project-from-cwd`) by
    determining the project's languages in a background thread #1683
  - Fix: in `glob_to_regex` / `search_text(is_glob=True)`, a `?` wildcard matched two characters instead
    of one (it emitted `..` rather than `.`); it now matches a single character, consistent with the
    `?` semantics documented for `glob_match` and the `test_??.py` example in `search_text`'s docstring.
  - Add notion of trusted projects via new global configuration setting `trusted_project_path_patterns`.
    Current effects:
    - `ls_specific_settings` defined in project configurations will only be applied for trusted projects
    - `activation_command` (and `activation_command_timeout`) defined in project configurations will only
      be executed for trusted projects: an optional shell command run in the project root before the
      language backend initialises (e.g. to generate source files a language server needs to index).
      Exit code is the primary completion signal; `activation_command_timeout` (default 180s) is a safety
      backstop — on expiry the process is killed and activation continues. Failures and timeouts are
      logged but do not abort activation.
  - Fix: context or mode argument referencing a known name (e.g. `--context anitgravity`) could result in   
    incorrect file access if a corresponding local file existed (e.g. `./antigravity` binary);
    file access is now guarded with path detection (file ending or path separator must be present)
  - Adjust prompt generation mechanism to use newly introduced tool name mapping `tool_names`, allowing
    prompts to directly use tool names that match the active language backend (and removing the need
    for additional prompts that explain tool name differences)
  - Improve quoting/escaping of arguments in shell executions on Windows (via `oslex` dependency)
  - Fix: a registered project whose root directory was deleted while Serena was already running could break
    `activate_project`/project lookup, raising `FileNotFoundError` in `RegisteredProject.matches_root_path`
  - Update prompts/instructions: Serena instructions manual, modes (editing, interactive) 
  - Allow structured tool output to be configured on a per-context basis, disabling it for Claude Code
    (which does not correctly unpack structured output) #1042
  - Fix: Project-specific filtering of files for source files ignored the language backend. 
    The check is really only possible for LSP. 
  - Fix: File system permission errors during gitignore scanning were not caught #1624
  - During project creation, language composition percentages are now computed relative to the total number 
    of recognised source files instead of all files, i.e. unrecognised files are ignored in the percentage 
    computation.
  - Consider all LSP-compliant line endings ("\n", "\r\n" and "\r") in `TextUtils`, noting that 
    only "\n" appears in files read by `FileUtils.read_file` (Serena's default reading mechanism)
  - Fix: Apply consistent line splitting across tools, uniformly applying the LSP splitting semantics; 
    affects `search_text` used by `search_for_pattern` tool (reported in #1684)
  - Fix in `TextUtils` (used by editors): Deleting up to the end of the file, referencing the line one past 
    the end of the file (particularly for files with no newline at end of file) raised `InvalidTextLocationError`
    instead of accepting the deletion (change in `TextUtils.delete_text_between_positions`,
    which now accepts the end position similar to `insert_text_at_position`).
  - Fix: glob pattern expansion in `expand_braces` did not terminate with empty or unbalanced braces #1690

* CLI:
  - Fix `--project-from-cwd` hijacking git worktrees nested under a Serena project. `find_project_root`
    now walks up in a single pass so the nearest project boundary wins (either a `.serena/project.yml`
    or a `.git`, including worktree/submodule pointer files), instead of preferring an ancestor's
    `.serena/project.yml` over a closer `.git`. This previously bound CLI agents (Claude Code, Codex,
    Gemini) launched from inside a worktree to the parent repo, causing stale reads and misdirected edits.
  - Fix: CLI flags on `start-mcp-server` could incorrectly be saved to the global configuration file if the
    list of projects was modified (triggering a save of the configuration with transient overrides applied)

* Tools:
  - New tool: `replace_in_files`
  - `get_symbols_overview`, `jet_brains_get_symbols_overview`: Improved default for `depth` parameter
  - Add tool parameter alias support, adding `name_path` as an alias for `name_path_pattern` in `find_symbol` tools
  - Allow `query_project` tool to access read-only tools that are not enabled in the current configuration
  - Make tool call errors surface explicitly as errors at the MCP protocol level

* Language Servers:
  - Fix: `SolidLanguageServer.is_ignored_path` raised `FileNotFoundError` for paths that are not present
    on disk, crashing symbol tools when a language server reported locations of generated files
    (e.g. JDTLS reporting Lombok-generated classes under `target/classes`). Missing paths are now
    classified by the usual ignore rules, and symbol locations resolving to non-existent files are skipped.
  - Solidity: fix diagnostics intermittently coming back empty on slow or cold environments (macOS/Windows CI).
  - Perl: expose `file_filter` and `ignore_dirs` via `ls_specific_settings["perl"]`, so projects with
    non-standard extensions (e.g. `.cgi`, `.psgi`) can make those files visible to Perl::LanguageServer.
    Configured extensions are also synced into the Perl source-file matcher (now a cached singleton),
    keeping `find_symbol` / symbol indexing consistent with the LS; the matcher is reset on every
    language server activation so one project's reconfiguration does not leak into the next.
    `FilenameMatcher` gains `add_extensions` / `reset` methods. Defaults are unchanged. #1449
  - C/C++ (clangd): improve support and documentation for Unreal Engine 5 projects.
  - HLSL (`shader-language-server`): pass `--locked` to `cargo install` when building from source
    on macOS (and in the manual-install instructions), honoring the crate's packaged `Cargo.lock`.
    Without it, fresh dependency resolution pulled in shader-sense 1.4.0, which no longer compiles
    against the pinned shader_language_server 1.3.1, breaking the macOS CI job.
  - `typescript_vts`: Add `initialization_options` setting in `ls_specific_settings.typescript_vts`. 
    Enables Yarn PnP setups with `typescript.tsdk` pointing at the Yarn-generated SDK.
  - TypeScript/VTS: disable automatic typing acquisition during initialization (no network
    downloads at startup) and replace the fixed 2-second cross-file reference wait with
    event-based `$/progress` indexing tracking (configurable `indexing_timeout`, default 30s)
  - C#: minor fixes in Omnisharp and Roslyn that prevented startup on some systems #1617
  - `SvelteLanguageServer`: Fix diagnostics requests for TypeScript/JavaScript files incorrectly being
    processed by the Svelte LS instead of the TypeScript LS.
  - `SvelteLanguageServer`: Fix document-symbol requests for TypeScript/JavaScript files returning empty
    results in svelte-only mode (`languages: [svelte]`. #1552
  - Svelte + TypeScript: make companion TypeScript server raise on readiness and indexing timeouts (instead
    of silent "proceeding anyway"), so that partial indexing surfaces as a clear failure instead of flaky/wrong
    cross-file results; add configurable timeouts (`server_ready_timeout`, `indexing_timeout`)
    and overridable timeout hooks (base TS stays permissive). Svelte test fixture now uses `npm ci` +
    committed `package-lock.json`.
  - `JuliaLanguageServer`: Fix the stdio MCP server exiting right after `initialize` ("tools fetch failed")
    when `julia` is enabled. #1577
  - `Java`: invalidate JDTLS workspace cache when Java import settings change #1576
  - `Java`: use `JAVA_HOME` for Gradle import when `use_system_java_home` is enabled and `gradle_java_home`
    is unset. #1657
  - `Java`: stop hard-ignoring directories named `target`/`build`/`bin`/`out`/`classes`/`dist`/`lib` in
    `EclipseJDTLS`. These are all valid Java package identifiers, so ignoring them by name hid legitimate
    source from the symbol tools even when they were not gitignored. Removed the hardcoded override; real
    build output is already excluded via `.gitignore`. #1645
  - Improve quoting of arguments in shell executions
  - Add **LaTeX** support (experimental) via [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab).
  - Add **QML** support via Qt's [`qmlls`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-tool-qmlls.html) language
    server (requires Qt 6 with `qmlls`/`qmlls6` on PATH). #1381
  - PHP: add support for PHPantom as alternative to the already supported PHP LS #1554.
  - Add new launch command customization options: `ls_args`, `ls_extra_args` and `ls_base_cmd`
  - Add new configuration option `ls_workspace_folders` to allow indexed source folders to be specified
    explicitly. In monorepos, this allows the set of indexed folders to be restricted to a subset of
    the repository. #1627
  - Rename configuration option `additional_workspace_folders` to `ls_additional_workspace_folders`
    and support the option across all language servers (previously limited to TypeScript).
  - `Pyright`: bump timeout for waiting for initial analysis from 5s to 60s.
  - Add **GraphQL** (experimental) using [graphql-language-service-cli](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-language-service) (`graphql-lsp`), installed with npm together with its `graphql` peer dependency into Serena-managed language-server resources. Handles `.graphql`/`.gql` files. With a [graphql-config](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/config) file (`.graphqlrc.yml` / `graphql.config.{yml,yaml,json}`) at the repository root, cross-file go-to-definition resolves operation fields into their schema type definitions; document symbols and typed hover work per file. Must be explicitly specified in `project.yml`. Note: the upstream server does not implement `textDocument/references`, so find-references is unsupported.

* JetBrains:
  - Add configuration option `jetbrains_launch_command`, allowing Serena to spawn IDE instances automatically
    upon project activation
  - Fix: `jet_brains_list_inspections` failed when only default parameters were used #1615 
  - Fix: `jet_brains_run_inspections` returned incorrectly transformed data (malforming snake-case conversion applied to all keys)

* Dashboard:
  - Make list of trusted hosts configurable, fixing host validation introduced in v1.5.2 allowing only
    default local hostnames, effectively preventing remote connections
  - Decouple configuration computation from the agent's task queue by introducing events for agent config/status updates.
    This allows the dashboard to display the configuration while the project provided at startup is still initialising. #1064
  - Fix empty executions queue displaying "Loading..."
  - Tray manager: Add NixOS-support for AppIndicator-based trays (e.g., most Wayland-trays) to the package in flake.nix.
  - Fix: Wait for the subprocess that opens the browser window, preventing zombie processes #1488 

* Hooks:
  - Handle tool_input passed as string gracefully instead of failing (Copilot CLI sends strings).

* Memories:
  - Make memory iteration follow symbolic links 
  - Fix: a memory name that was absolute (e.g. `/etc/cron.d/backdoor`) or contained empty path
    segments could write outside the `memories` folder.

* Dependencies:
  - Add dependency `oslex`

# v1.5.3 (2026-05-26)

Add meta-data for the GitHub MCP registry

# v1.5.2 (2026-05-26)

* General:
  - Not existing paths return `False` on is ignored checks (instead of raising an error)
  - Add `serena-agent` CLI command so that `uvx serena-agent` can be used as entrypoint.
  - Fortls and pyright are now installed on the fly instead of being bundled in the serena-agent package.

* Dashboard:
  - Add host validation

* Hooks:
  - Extend list of extensions that are considered code files (affects the reminder hook counter).

# v1.5.1 (2026-05-18)

* General:
  - Fix `onboarding_tool`: Used incorrect path to bootstrap memory (regression in v1.5.0)  
 
* Language Servers:
  - Add **CUE** support via the LSP mode of the official [`cue` CLI](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue) (`cue lsp`).

# v1.5.0 (2026-05-18)

* General:
  - Make tool descriptions more amenable to tool search mechanisms as now used in several clients (e.g. avoid referencing other tools' names, etc.)
  - Onboarding is now less invasive (LLM is instructed to ask the user whether to proceed)

* Language Servers:
  - No longer store temporary files (e.g. downloads) in `~/solidlsp_tmp`; instead, use OS-specific temporary directories
  - Add **GDScript** (Godot Engine) support. Serena connects over TCP to the Godot editor's built-in LSP server (port 6008, same for Godot 3 and 4) — no separate language server process to install. Godot major version is auto-detected from `config_version` in `project.godot`. Note: Godot's LSP does not implement `workspace/symbol`; first workspace-wide scans fall back to per-file requests and can be slow for large projects (results are cached to disk). See the [GDScript Setup Guide](https://oraios.github.io/serena/03-special-guides/godot_gdscript_setup_guide_for_serena.html) for details. Closes #1446.

* Dashboard:
  - UI polish: switch UI font to Inter (with system fallbacks) and use JetBrains Mono only for code/logs/paths/identifiers; refine the light/dark palette with softer borders, clearer text hierarchy, and a more nuanced shadow/elevation system; introduce a consistent spacing scale; keep the orange accent.
  - Modal markup cleanup: extract shared CSS classes (`.modal-info`, `.modal-hint`, `.modal-prompt`, `.modal-field`, `.modal-input`, `.modal-select`, `.modal-textarea`, `.modal-actions`, `.btn-secondary`) and remove duplicated inline styles from all seven modals. Inputs and textareas get an accent-colored focus ring; the modal backdrop has a subtle blur.
  - Add Language: replace the native `<select>` with a filterable combobox — type to filter, keyboard navigation (Up/Down/Enter/Esc), substring highlight, click-outside to close. The typed value is validated against the available languages list before submission.

* Memories:
  - Memories can now reference each other using the `mem:<name>` convention. Renames
    propagate to all references automatically. See the [reference convention](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/045_memories.html#referencing-memories-from-other-memories).
  - Onboarding now seeds a `memory_maintenance` memory describing the memory-style and conventions, 
    and the agent is instructed to read it before writing any other memories. 
    A `global/memory_maintenance` memory takes precedence over the per-project seed. 
    See the [memory maintenance section](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/045_memories.html#the-memory-maintenance-memory).
   
* CLI:
  - Add `serena memories` CLI command group: `list`, `read`, `write`, `check` (referential
    integrity report) and `auto-prefix-references` (heuristic rewrite of bare occurrences).
    See the [CLI subcommands](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/045_memories.html#cli-subcommands).

* Tools:
  - `search_for_pattern`: Add parameter `multiline`
  - Delete `check_onboarding_performed` tool (instead extend project activation message)

# v1.3.0 (2026-05-11)

* General:
  - Breaking change in mode definitions: Projects (project.yml) can no longer override `base_modes`.
    Instead, they can define `added_modes` to add modes on top of base and default modes.  
    See updated [documentation on modes](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/050_configuration.html#modes).
  - Serena's default configuration now uses `interactive` and `editing` as `base_modes` instead of as `default_modes`.
  - Fixed path validation in `search_for_pattern` tool (thanks to [@dodge1218](https://github.com/dodge1218) for the report)
  - Fix: In HTTP/SSE mode, a client disconnection triggered a partial agent shutdown (project deactivation, dashboard manager & GUI viewer shutdown)
  
* JetBrains:
  - Add new tools:
    - `jet_brains_list_inspections`: Lists available IDE inspections (akin to diagnostics), optionally filtered by language or group
    - `jet_brains_run_inspections`: Runs IDE inspections on a file and returns the results

* LSP Backend:
  - Add cross-package reference support via `additional_workspace_folders` setting (currently implemented for TypeScript).
  - Add new tools:
    - `find_declaration`: Finds the declaration/definition of a symbol
    - `find_implementations`: Finds the implementations of an interface or abstract method
    - `get_diagnostics_for_file`: Retrieves diagnostics for a specific file (errors, warnings, etc.)
    - `get_diagnostics_for_symbol`: Retrieves diagnostics pertaining to a specific symbol

* Language Servers:
  - Add **Svelte** support via `svelte-language-server@0.18.0`, installed with npm into Serena-managed language-server resources. The `svelte` language handles `.svelte` Single File Components plus TypeScript/JavaScript files for Svelte projects; use it instead of also enabling `typescript` unless intentionally running multiple language servers.
  - Elixir (`elixir-tools/next-ls`): Fix deadlock in monorepo projects where `mix.exs` lives in a subdirectory. The server now searches immediate subdirectories when no `mix.exs` is found at the repository root. #1444
  - Java (`eclipse.jdt.ls`): Add upstream JDTLS mode for offline / restricted-network use. Setting both `jdtls_path` and `lombok_path` in `ls_specific_settings.java` makes Serena use an existing upstream JDTLS installation (e.g. `brew install jdtls`) and the system JDK 21+, skipping the ~500 MB vscode-java VSIX, Gradle, and IntelliCode downloads. New related setting `java_home` lets the user override the JDK used to launch JDTLS. Default behavior unchanged — the JDTLS workspace hash is preserved bit-for-bit for users on the default route, so existing project caches are reused without a one-time reindex; the launcher path is mixed into the hash only when `jdtls_path` is set, isolating upstream installations from the default workspace. #1415
  - Java (eclipse.jdt.ls): Lombok-generated methods (getters/setters, builder(), equals/hashCode/toString, etc.) are now included in symbol-based tools (find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, edits). Added lombok_show_generated setting (default: on) to toggle this. Updated bundled vscode-java to 1.54.0-923. Issue #1432.
  - Add **Ada / SPARK** support using AdaCore's [Ada Language Server](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server). Auto-downloads the official prebuilt ALS binary (linux-x64/arm64, darwin-x64/arm64, win32-x64). A single `ada` language covers both Ada and SPARK, since the server uses the same `.ads`/`.adb` files for both and distinguishes SPARK by source-level pragmas/aspects. Users can override the binary by setting `ls_specific_settings.ada.ls_path` to a pre-installed `ada_language_server` (e.g. from Alire, GNAT Studio, or the VS Code Ada extension).
  - Add **Angular** (experimental) via a dual-server architecture: `@angular/language-server` (ngserver) handles standalone `.html` template files, while a companion `typescript-language-server` with `@angular/language-service` loaded as a tsserver plugin handles all `.ts` operations including inline templates. Provides type-aware navigation between templates and component classes. Requires Node.js, npm, and `@angular/core` installed in the project (`npm install` in the project root). Subsumes `typescript`+`html` for `.ts`/`.html` files when active; SCSS is not subsumed.
  - Add **HTML** (experimental) using `vscode-html-language-server` from the `vscode-langservers-extracted` npm package. Provides in-file element/id symbols via documentSymbol; cross-file references are not meaningful for HTML. Also used as a companion server by the Angular LS for plain HTML documentSymbol support.
  - Add **SCSS / Sass / CSS** (experimental) using [some-sass-language-server](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass). Handles `.scss`, `.sass`, and `.css` through one server, with full `@use`/`@forward` workspace-wide go-to-definition and find-references for variables, mixins, and functions across Sass files. The `.css` path uses the same `vscode-css-languageservice` engine that powers the standalone CSS LS; CSS feature toggles default off upstream and are flipped on at startup so symbols, hover, completion, and syntax-level diagnostics work for plain CSS as well.
  - Add **1C / OneScript** support using [BSL Language Server](https://github.com/1c-syntax/bsl-language-server/).
  - Add support for more filenames to be considered by ccls and clangd.
  - Clojure (`clojure-lsp`): Fix incomplete `find_referencing_symbols` results in multi-module monorepos. clojure-lsp only discovers source paths from the descriptor at the workspace root and does not recurse for sub-module `deps.edn` / `project.clj` / `shadow-cljs.edn` / `bb.edn` files, so references in sibling modules were silently missed until those files happened to be opened by `find_symbol` / `get_symbols_overview`. Serena now scans the repo for project descriptors at startup and passes the union of their declared source paths to clojure-lsp via `initializationOptions`. Project-local `.lsp/config.edn` files are honoured as-is (no override). New `ls_specific_settings.clojure` keys: `source_paths` (explicit override) and `config_edn_path` (parse `:source-paths` from a user-supplied config file).

* Hooks:
  - `serena-hooks auto-approve` now also emits an `allow` decision when Claude Code reports
    `permission_mode == "auto"`, in addition to the existing `acceptEdits` behavior. #1386
  - Extension: heuristics for parsing commands and firing a hook on too many greps or reads. Important for clients that, unlike claude code, don't have dedicated grep/read tools.
  - Read hook now only fires on reads of code files (using heuristics to parse the read command string)
  - Reminder hook now also counts and fires on usages of serena's non-symbolic tools.

# v1.2.0 (2026-04-27)

* General:
  - Fix: Check for ignored path ignored `.git` folder only at the top level, not in every subdirectory (`Project._is_ignored_relative_path`) #1350
  - `GetSymbolsOverviewTool`: ignored paths were not respected in LSP variant (fix in `SolidLanguageServer`)
  - Fix: Duplicate comments in re-saved YAML configuration files #1285
  - Prompt provision improvements (project activation, initial instructions):
     - Prompt provision is now session-aware, i.e. when using the MCP server in HTTP mode, prompts are provided for each session separately, 
       ensuring that the necessary information is always provided to the LLM
     - Fix: Prompts of dynamically activated modes (upon project activation) were not necessarily passed to the LLM (only in the system prompt via
       `initial_instructions`). Now they are passed directly in the activation message (and excluded from a subsequent `initial_instructions` call).
     - Fix: Project activation message was provided more than once for case of dynamic project activation followed
       by `initial_instructions` #1372
     - Always provide full activation message upon calling `activate_project` (even if project was already active in the same session) #1384
       This is necessary, because some clients (e.g. Claude Desktop) will reuse a single session across chats.
  - Security: Forbid `".."` in memory names to disallow accessing files outside dedicated memory directories
  - Security: Add check for tool being read-only in the project server (previously only checked in `query_project` tool, i.e. client side)
  - Usage reporting now also includes the name of the Serena context that is used 
  - Fix: restricted `insert_after_symbol` to raise if used on an assignment or similar (can't reliably determine the symbol range)
  - Fix: Failure to collect project ignore spec now logs the error and downstream tasks fail fast, fixing hanging LS initialisation
  - Improve loading of `project.yml` files: Gracefully handle user errors involving incorrect use of None/empty instead of list
  - Project server: 
     - `query_project`: Support use of project root instead of project name #1388
     - `list_queryable_projects`: Return both project names and project roots 
  - Fix: `search_for_pattern` tool returned 1-based line numbers (in contrast to all other tools); cause: implementation of `text_utils.search_text`
  - Serena's system prompt (a.k.a. the 'Serena Instructions Manual') is now provided lazily. 
    At MCP connection time, only a one-sentence bootstrap prompt is provided.
    The `initial_instructions` tool provides the full prompt on demand, keeping the initial context lean.
  - Add `serena_info` tool for on-demand retrieval of usage information

* CLI:
  - Support `serena --version` CLI command for displaying the current version #1347
  - Extend `prompts` subcommand with `print-prompt-template` and `print-cc-system-prompt-override`, improve `list` subcommand

* Clients:
  - Document workaround to make Claude Code use Serena's tools after recent degradations caused by changes in CC harness and Opus 4.7 release.

* JetBrains:
  - Add `debug` tool: The agent can set breakpoints, inspect variables, evaluate expressions and control execution flow
    by directly interacting with the IDE's debugger, using a REPL-style interface for maximum flexibility.  
  - `move` and `safe_delete` tools: transform empty string to None (counteracts client errors)

* Dependencies:
  - `pywebview`: Switch back to official release (new version 6.2) #1253
  - `mcp`: Update from `1.26.0` to `1.27.0`

* Evaluations:
  - Added new evaluations for Junie Plugin with Opus 4.6 and GLM 5.1 in Claude Code.

* Language Servers:
  - Fix: clangd capability checks now tolerate valid initialize response shape differences and invalidate cached C++ document symbols when clangd/compile commands context changes #1359                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  - Fix: `rename_symbol` for Vue files now correctly propagates edits to the TypeScript server, enabling cross-file renames in `.vue` files 
  - Fix: Lean4 stale cache — empty document symbol responses (returned before `lake build` completes) are no longer persisted, preventing symbols from being permanently hidden #1356
  - Add JSON language server support via `vscode-json-languageserver` (experimental) #1391
  - Fix: Elixir/Expert deadlock on startup — Expert's build pipeline requires a `textDocument/didOpen` notification to start; Serena now opens `mix.exs` immediately after `initialized` so Expert begins compiling instead of waiting indefinitely #1397

* Dashboard:
  - Add configurable dashboard interface mode (new global configuration setting `web_dashboard_interface`):
    Three modes (browser, native app with tray, tray manager for aggregating multiple instances) are supported, depending on the OS
  - Fix: Memory leaks in frontend when using Chromium-based browsers/Windows webview #1389

* Hooks:
  - Adjusted wording of startup hook, improving project activation instructions #1401.

# v1.1.2 (2026-04-14)

* General:
  - Support environment variable `SERENA_USAGE_REPORTING` (set to `false` to disable usage reporting)
  - Extended the list of always ignored directories (by language servers) with common cases.
  - Improve exposed toolset: With mode switching no longer being a feature, we now fully apply tool exclusions 
    defined by modes when in a single-project context (limiting exposed tools to a minimum)
  - Fix: When scanning for `.gitignore` files, the presence of files that could not be made relative 
    to the project root would cause the scan to fail. #1317

* Dashboard:
  - Fix handling of read news, saving each read news entry separately #1338

* JetBrains: 
  - Improve handling of `relative_path` parameter 
     - Improve its documentation to avoid usage errors
     - Replace escaped characters in `relative_path` with their unescaped counterparts (&lt; and &gt;)
     - `FindSymbolTool`: Force `search_deps=True` if `relative_path` pertains to external dependencies.

* Language Servers:
  - Add mSL (mIRC Scripting Language) support (custom pygls-based language server; symbols, references, definitions)
  - Fix initialisation issues in Vue language server #1333

# v1.1.1 (2026-04-12)

* General:
  - Enable cert verification for HTTPS request to oraios-software.de #1320

* JetBrains:
  - `JetBrainsRenameTool` can now also rename occurrences in comments and text.

* Language Servers:
  - Fix Dart LSP returning only symbol name as body instead of full method body.


# v1.1.0 (2026-04-11)

* General:
  - **Major**: Add commands for hooks and documentation of recommended setup. Consider setting up the [recommended hooks](https://oraios.github.io/serena/02-usage/030_clients.html) !
  - Add `serena init` and `serena setup` commands
  - Rework installation instructions, switching to releases on pypi for distribution. Please update your mcp startup commands!
  - Add minimal usage data collection on startup (only Serena version, language backend, OS, dashboard enabled status; no personally identifiable information)
  - Fix: git commit id in Serena version strings was incorrect

* Language Servers:
  - Add support for Haxe via vshaxe/haxe-language-server. Requires Haxe compiler 3.4.0+ and Node.js. Auto-discovered from the vshaxe VSCode extension or configurable via `ls_path` in `ls_specific_settings`.
  - Add Crystal language support (uses [Crystalline](https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline) language server)
  - Fix: Reactivation of the same project restarted language servers #1280

* JetBrains:
  - `JetBrainsFindReferencingSymbolTool`: Include context lines (when using plugin version 2023.2.15+)

* Dashboard:
  - Add version display
  - Fix: Dashboard viewer (Windows): Add a parent monitoring thread to ensure termination.
    Some clients would terminate the MCP server in a way that did not ensure proper termination.
  - Fix: Manual server shutdown triggered by GUI tool/dashboard not cleaning everything up.

# v1.0.0 (2026-04-03)

* General:
    * Add monorepo/multi-language support
        * Project configuration files (`project.yml`) can now define multiple languages.
          Auto-detection adds only the most prominent language by default.
        * Additional languages can be conveniently added via the Dashboard while a project is already activated.
    * Add support for querying projects other than the currently active one via new tools `QueryProjectTool` and `ListQueryableProjectsTool`.
      The `QueryProjectTool` allows Serena tools to be called on other projects.
        * For the LSP backend, calling symbolic tools require a project server to be spawned that will launch the respective language servers
        * For the JetBrains backend, all projects for which IDE instances are open can directly be queried
    * Support overloaded symbols in `FindSymbolTool` and related tools
        * Name paths of overloaded symbols now include an index (e.g., `myOverloadedFunction[2]`)
        * Responses of the Java language server, which handled this in its own way, are now adapted accordingly,
          solving several issues related to retrieval problems in Java projects
    * Major extensions to the dashboard, which now serves as a central web interface for Serena
        * View current configuration
        * View news which can be marked as read
        * View the executions, with the possibility to cancel running/scheduled executions
        * View tool usage statistics
        * View and create memories and edit the serena configuration file
        * Log page now has save (downloads a snapshot) and clear (resets log view) buttons alongside the existing copy button
    * Language server backend:
        * New two-tier caching of language server document symbols and considerable performance improvements surrounding symbol retrieval/indexing
        * Allow passing language server-specific settings through `ls_specific_settings` field (in `serena_config.yml`)
    * Add the JetBrains language backend as an alternative to language servers
    * Improve management of Serena projects
        * Facilitate project activation based on the current directory (through the `--project-from-cwd` parameter)
        * Add notion of a "single-project context" (flag `single_project`), allowing user-defined contexts to behave
          like the built-in `ide-assistant` context (where the available tools are restricted to ones required by the active
          project and project changes are disabled)
        * The location of Serena's project-specific data folder can now be flexibly configured, allowing, in particular,
          locations outside of the project folder, thus improving support for read-only projects.
        * Add support for `project.local.yml` for local overrides that should not be versioned 
    * Various fixes related to indexing, special paths and determination of ignored paths
    * Memories:
        * Add support for global memories (shared across projects) 
        * Add `read_only_memory_patterns` configuration option
        * Add `ignored_memory_patterns` configuration option
    * Improved client support, e.g. new mode `oaicompat-agent` and extensions enhancing OpenAI tool compatibility

* Tools:
  * Additional symbol meta-information (hover, docstring, quick-info) is now provided as part of `find_symbol` and related tool responses.
  * Added `QueryProjectTool` and `ListQueryableProjectTool` (see above)
  * Added `RenameSymbolTool` for renaming symbols across the codebase (if LS supports this operation).
  * Replaced `ReplaceRegexTool` with `ReplaceContentTool`, which supports both plain text and regex-based replacements
    (and which requires no escaping in the replacement text, making it more robust)
  * Add JetBrains tools which leverage the corresponding JetBrains language backend through our plugin
  * Decreased `TOOL_DEFAULT_MAX_ANSWER_LENGTH` to be in accordance with (below) typical max-tokens configurations

* Language support:

  * **Add support for Lean 4** via built-in `lean --server` with cross-file reference support (requires `lean` and `lake` via [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan))
  * **Add support for OCaml** via ocaml-lsp-server with cross-file reference support on OCaml 5.2+ (requires opam; see [setup guide](docs/03-special-guides/ocaml_setup_guide_for_serena.md))
  * **Add Phpactor as alternative PHP language server** (specify `php_phpactor` as language; requires PHP 8.1+)
  * **Add support for Fortran** via fortls language server (requires `pip install fortls`)
  * **Add partial support for Groovy** requires user-provided Groovy language server JAR (see [setup guide](docs/03-special-guides/groovy_setup_guide_for_serena.md))
  * **Add support for Julia** via LanguageServer.jl
  * **Add support for Haskell** via Haskell Language Server (HLS) with automatic discovery via ghcup, stack, or system PATH; supports both Stack and Cabal projects
  * **Add support for Scala** via Metals language server (requires some [manual setup](docs/03-special-guides/scala_setup_guide_for_serena.md))
  * **Add support for F#** via FsAutoComplete/Ionide LSP server. 
  * **Add support for Elm** via @elm-tooling/elm-language-server (automatically downloads if not installed; requires Elm compiler)
  * **Add support for Perl** via Perl::LanguageServer with LSP integration for .pl, .pm, and .t files
  * **Add support for AL (Application Language)** for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central development. Requires VS Code AL extension (ms-dynamics-smb.al).
  * **Add support for R** via the R languageserver package with LSP integration, performance optimizations, and fallback symbol extraction
  * **Add support for Zig** via ZLS (cross-file references may not fully work on Windows)
  * **Add support for Lua** via lua-language-server

  * **Kotlin now officially supported**: We now use the official Kotlin LS, tests run through and performance is good, even though the LS is in an early development stage.
  * **Add support for Erlang** experimental, may hang or be slow, uses the recently archived [erlang_ls](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls)
  * **Ruby dual language server support**: Added ruby-lsp as the modern primary Ruby language server. Solargraph remains available as an experimental legacy option. ruby-lsp supports both .rb and .erb files, while Solargraph supports .rb files only.
  * **Add support for PowerShell** via PowerShell Editor Services (PSES). Requires `pwsh` (PowerShell Core) to be installed and available in PATH. Supports symbol navigation, go-to-definition, and within-file references for .ps1 files.
  * **Add support for MATLAB** via the official MathWorks MATLAB Language Server. Requires MATLAB R2021b or later and Node.js. Set `MATLAB_PATH` environment variable or configure `matlab_path` in `ls_specific_settings`. Supports .m, .mlx, and .mlapp files with code completion, diagnostics, go-to-definition, find references, document symbols, formatting, and rename.
  * **Add support for Pascal** via the official Pascal Language Server.
  * **C/C++ alternate LS (ccls)**: Add experimental, opt-in support for ccls as an alternative backend to clangd. Enable via `cpp_ccls` in project configuration. Requires `ccls` installed and ideally a `compile_commands.json` at repo root.
  * **Add support for Solidity** via the Nomic Foundation `@nomicfoundation/solidity-language-server` (automatically installed via npm)

# v0.1.4 (2025-08-15)

## Summary

This likely is the last release before the stable version 1.0.0 which will come together with the jetbrains IDE extension.
We release it for users who install Serena from a tag, since the last tag cannot be installed due to a breaking change in the mcp dependency (see #381).

Since the last release, several new languages were supported, and the Serena CLI and configurability were significantly extended.
We thank all external contributors who made a lot of the improvements possible!

* General:
  * **Initial instructions no longer need to be loaded by the user**
  * Significantly extended CLI
  * Removed `replace_regex` tool from `ide-assistant` and `codex` contexts.
    The current string replacement tool in Claude Code seems to be sufficiently efficient and is better
    integrated with the IDE. Users who want to enable `replace_regex` can do so by customizing the context.

* Configuration:
  * Simplify customization of modes and contexts, including CLI support.
  * Possibility to customize the system prompt and outputs of simple tools, including CLI support.
  * Possibility to override tool descriptions through the context YAML.
  * Prompt templates are now automatically adapted to the enabled tools.
  * Several tools are now excluded by default, need to be included explicitly.
  * New context for ChatGPT

* Language servers:
  * Reliably detect language server termination and propagate the respective error all the way
    back to the tool application, where an unexpected termination is handled by restarting the language server
    and subsequently retrying the tool application.
  * **Add support for Swift**
  * **Add support for Bash**
  * Enhance Solargraph (Ruby) integration
    * Automatic Rails project detection via config/application.rb, Rakefile, and Gemfile analysis
    * Ruby/Rails-specific exclude patterns for improved indexing performance (vendor/, .bundle/, tmp/, log/, coverage/)
    * Enhanced error handling with detailed diagnostics and Ruby manager-specific installation instructions (rbenv, RVM, asdf)
    * Improved LSP capability negotiation and analysis completion detection
    * Better Bundler and Solargraph installation error messages with clear resolution steps

Fixes:
* Ignore `.git` in check for ignored paths and improve performance of `find_all_non_ignored_files`
* Fix language server startup issues on Windows when using Claude Code (which was due to
  default shell reconfiguration imposed by Claude Code)
* Additional wait for initialization in C# language server before requesting references, allowing cross-file references to be found.

# v0.1.3 (2025-07-22)

## Summary

This is the first release of Serena to pypi. Since the last release, we have greatly improved 
stability and performance, as well as extended functionality, improved editing tools and included support for several new languages. 

* **Reduce the use of asyncio to a minimum**, improving stability and reducing the need for workarounds
   * Switch to newly developed fully synchronous LSP library `solidlsp` (derived from `multilspy`),
     removing our fork of `multilspy` (src/multilspy)
   * Switch from fastapi (which uses asyncio) to Flask in the Serena dashboard
   * The MCP server is the only asyncio-based component now, which resolves cross-component loop contamination,
     such that process isolation is no longer required.
     Neither are non-graceful shutdowns on Windows.
* **Improved editing tools**: The editing logic was simplified and improved, making it more robust.
   * The "minimal indentation" logic was removed, because LLMs did not understand it.
   * The logic for the insertion of empty lines was improved (mostly controlled by the LLM now)
* Add a task queue for the agent, which is executed in a separate and thread and
   * allows the language server to be initialized in the background, making the MCP server respond to requests
     immediately upon startup,
   * ensures that all tool executions are fully synchronized (executed linearly).
* `SearchForPatternTool`: Better default, extended parameters and description for restricting the search
* Language support:
   * Better support for C# by switching from `omnisharp` to Microsoft's official C# language server.
   * **Add support for Clojure, Elixir and Terraform. New language servers for C# and typescript.**
   * Experimental language server implementations can now be accessed by users through configuring the `language` field
* Configuration:
   * Add option `web_dashboard_open_on_launch` (allowing the dashboard to be enabled without opening a browser window) 
   * Add options `record_tool_usage_stats` and `token_count_estimator`
   * Serena config, modes and contexts can now be adjusted from the user's home directory.
   * Extended CLI to help with configuration
* Dashboard:
  * Displaying tool usage statistics if enabled in the config

Fixes:
* Fix `ExecuteShellCommandTool` and `GetCurrentConfigTool` hanging on Windows
* Fix project activation by name via `--project` not working (was broken in previous release) 
* Improve handling of indentation and newlines in symbolic editing tools
* Fix `InsertAfterSymbolTool` failing for insertions at the end of a file that did not end with a newline
* Fix `InsertBeforeSymbolTool` inserting in the wrong place in the absence of empty lines above the reference symbol
* Fix `ReplaceSymbolBodyTool` changing whitespace before/after the symbol
* Fix repository indexing not following links and catch exceptions during indexing, allowing indexing
  to continue even if unexpected errors occur for individual files.
* Fix `ImportError` in Ruby language server.
* Fix some issues with gitignore matching and interpreting of regexes in `search_for_pattern` tool.

# 2025-06-20

* **Overhaul and major improvement of editing tools!**
  This represents a very important change in Serena. Symbols can now be addressed by their `name_path` (including nested ones)
  and we introduced a regex-based replaced tools. We tuned the prompts and tested the new editing mechanism.
  It is much more reliable, flexible, and at the same time uses fewer tokens.
  The line-replacement tools are disabled by default and deprecated, we will likely remove them soon.
* **Better multi-project support and zero-config setup**: We significantly simplified the config setup, you no longer need to manually
  create `project.yaml` for each project. Project activation is now always available. 
  Any project can now be activated by just asking the LLM to do so and passing the path to a repo.
* Dashboard as web app and possibility to shut down Serena from it (or the old log GUI).
* Possibility to index your project beforehand, accelerating Serena's tools.
* Initial prompt for project supported (has to be added manually for the moment)
* Massive performance improvement of pattern search tool
* Use **process isolation** to fix stability issues and deadlocks (see #170). 
  This uses separate process for the MCP server, the Serena agent and the dashboard in order to fix asyncio-related issues.

# 2025-05-24

* Important new feature: **configurability of mode and context**, allowing better integration in a variety of clients.
  See corresponding section in readme - Serena can now be integrated in IDE assistants in a more productive way. 
  You can now also do things like switching to one-shot planning mode, ask to plan something (which will create a memory),
  then switch to interactive editing mode in the next conversation and work through the plan read from the memory.
* Some improvements to prompts.

# 2025-05-21

**Significant improvement in symbol finding!**

* Serena core:
    * `FindSymbolTool` now can look for symbols by specifying paths to them, not just the symbol name
* Language Servers:
    * Fixed `gopls` initialization
    * Symbols retrieved through the symbol tree or through overview methods now are linked to their parents


# 2025-05-19

* Serena core:
    * Bugfix in `FindSymbolTool` (a bug fixed in LS)
    * Fix in `ListDirTool`: Do not ignore files with extensions not understood by the language server, only skip ignored directories
      (error introduced in previous version)
    * Merged the two overview tools (for directories and files) into a single one: `GetSymbolsOverviewTool`
    * One-click setup for Cline enabled
    * `SearchForPatternTool` can now (optionally) search in the entire project
    * New tool `RestartLanguageServerTool` for restarting the language server (in case of other sources of editing apart from Serena)
    * Fix `CheckOnboardingPerformedTool`:
        * Tool description was incompatible with project change
        * Returned result was not as useful as it could be (now added list of memories)

* Language Servers:
    * Add further file extensions considered by the language servers for Python (.pyi), JavaScript (.jsx) and TypeScript (.tsx, .jsx)
    * Updated multilspy, adding support for Kotlin, Dart and C/C++ and several improvements.
    * Added support for PHP
    

# 2025-04-07

> **Breaking Config Changes**: make sure to set `ignore_all_files_in_gitignore`, remove `ignore_dirs`
>  and (optionally) set `ignore_paths` in your project configs. See [updated config template](myproject.template.yml)

* Serena core:
    * New tool: FindReferencingCodeSnippets
    * Adjusted prompt in CreateTextFileTool to prevent writing partial content (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jpavtm/comment/mloek1x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)).
    * FindSymbolTool: allow passing a file for restricting search, not just a directory (Gemini was too dumb to pass directories)
    * Native support for gitignore files for configuring files to be ignored by serena. See also
      in *Language Servers* section below.
    * **Major Feature**: Allow Serena to switch between projects (project activation)
        * Add central Serena configuration in `serena_config.yml`, which 
            * contains the list of available projects
            * allows to configure whether project activation is enabled
            * now contains the GUI logging configuration (project configurations no longer do)
        * Add new tools `activate_project` and `get_active_project`
        * Providing a project configuration file in the launch parameters is now optional
* Logging:
    * Improve error reporting in case of initialization failure: 
      open a new GUI log window showing the error or ensure that the existing log window remains visible for some time
* Language Servers:
    * Fix C# language server initialization issue when the project path contains spaces
    * Native support for gitignore in overview, document-tree and find_references operations.
      This is an **important** addition, since previously things like `venv` and `node_modules` were scanned
      and were likely responsible for slowness of tools and even server crashes (presumably due to OOM errors).
* Agno: 
    * Fix Agno reloading mechanism causing failures when initializing the sqlite memory database #8
    * Fix Serena GUI log window not capturing logs after initialization
