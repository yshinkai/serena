# Language Support

Serena provides a set of versatile code querying and editing functionalities
based on symbolic understanding of the code across a wide range of programming languages.
Equipped with these capabilities, Serena discovers and edits code just like a seasoned developer
making use of an IDE's capabilities would.
Serena can efficiently find the right context and do the right thing even in very large and
complex projects!

There are two alternative technologies powering these capabilities:

* **Language servers** implementing the language server Protocol (LSP) — the free/open-source alternative.
* **The Serena JetBrains Plugin**, which leverages the powerful code analysis and editing
  capabilities of your JetBrains IDE.

See the [Features](025_features) section for a detailed comparison of the capabilities provided by the JetBrains Plugin vs. language servers.

## Language Servers

Serena incorporates a powerful abstraction layer for the integration of language servers 
that implement the language server protocol (LSP).
It even supports multiple language servers in parallel to support polyglot projects.

The language servers themselves are typically open-source projects (like Serena)
or at least freely available for use.

We currently provide direct, out-of-the-box support for the programming languages listed below.
Some languages require additional installations or setup steps, as noted.

* **Ada / SPARK**  
  (uses AdaCore's [Ada Language Server (ALS)](https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_language_server),
  automatically downloaded; supports `.ads`, `.adb`, and `.ada` files;
  works best with a `.gpr` GNAT project file at the repository root;
  SPARK is handled by the same server transparently — set language `ada` for both.
  To use a pre-installed ALS (e.g. from Alire, GNAT Studio, or the VS Code Ada extension),
  set `ls_specific_settings.ada.ls_path`.)
* **AL**
* **Angular**  
  (experimental; requires Node.js + npm, plus `npm install` having been run in the project root so that `@angular/core`
  is resolvable — without it, template-aware features silently return empty;
  subsumes `typescript` and `html` for `.ts`/`.html` files, so do not also list those)
* **Ansible**  
  (experimental; requires Node.js and npm; automatically installs `@ansible/ansible-language-server`;
  must be explicitly specified in the `languages` entry in the `project.yml`; requires `ansible` in PATH for full functionality)
  the upstream `@ansible/ansible-language-server@1.2.3` supports hover, completion, definition,
  semantic tokens, and validation; document symbols, workspace symbols, references, and rename
  are not supported by this version)
* **Bash**
* **BSL** (1C:Enterprise / OneScript)  
  (requires Java 21+ on PATH; uses [bsl-language-server](https://github.com/1c-syntax/bsl-language-server) by 1c-syntax; the JAR is auto-downloaded and SHA-256-verified for the bundled default version; supports `.bsl` and `.os` files; configure optional `ls_path` or `bsl_ls_version` under `ls_specific_settings.bsl`)
* **C#**  
  (by default, uses the Roslyn language server (language `csharp`), requiring [.NET v10+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) and, on Windows, `pwsh` ([PowerShell 7+](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5));
  set language to `csharp_omnisharp` to use OmiSharp instead)
* **C/C++**  
  (by default, uses the clangd language server (language `cpp`) but we also support ccls (language `cpp_ccls`);
  for best results, provide a `compile_commands.json` at the repository root;
  see the [C/C++ Setup Guide](../03-special-guides/cpp_setup) for details;
  for Unreal Engine 5 projects, see the [Unreal Engine Setup Guide](../03-special-guides/unreal_engine_setup_guide_for_serena).)
* **Clojure**
* **Crystal**  
  (requires [Crystalline](https://github.com/elbywan/crystalline) language server to be installed and available on PATH;
  note: Crystalline has limited go-to-definition support and does not support find-references)
* **CUE**
* **Dart**
* **Elixir**  
  (requires Elixir installation; Expert language server is downloaded automatically)
* **Elm**  
  (requires Elm compiler)
* **Erlang**  
  (requires installation of beam and [erlang_ls](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls); experimental, might be slow or hang;
  note that functions are addressed as `name#arity`, e.g. `create_user#4`, because `/` is reserved as the name path separator)
* **F#**  
  (requires [.NET v8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet); uses FsAutoComplete/Ionide, which is auto-installed; for Homebrew .NET on macOS, set DOTNET_ROOT in your environment)
* **Fortran**   
  (requires installation of fortls: `pip install fortls`)
* **GDScript** (Godot Engine)  
  (requires the Godot editor to be running with its built-in LSP enabled — default on port 6008;
  Serena connects over TCP and does not launch Godot itself;
  see the [GDScript Setup Guide](../03-special-guides/godot_gdscript_setup_guide_for_serena) for details)
* **Go**  
  (requires installation of `gopls`)
* **GraphQL**  
  (experimental; requires Node.js and npm; automatically installs `graphql-language-service-cli` (`graphql-lsp`) and its
  `graphql` peer dependency; handles `.graphql` and `.gql` files; must be explicitly specified in the `languages` entry
  in the `project.yml`. Cross-file navigation — go-to-definition from an operation field into the schema type that
  declares it — requires a [graphql-config](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/config) file
  (`.graphqlrc.yml` / `graphql.config.{yml,yaml,json}`) at the repository root pointing at the schema; without it only
  single-file document symbols are available. Note: the upstream server does not implement `textDocument/references`,
  so find-references is unsupported.)
* **Groovy**  
  (requires local groovy-language-server.jar setup via `GROOVY_LS_JAR_PATH` or configuration)
* **Haskell**  
  (automatically locates HLS via ghcup, stack, or system PATH; supports Stack and Cabal projects)
* **Haxe**
  (requires Haxe compiler 3.4.0+ and Node.js; uses the [vshaxe language server](https://github.com/vshaxe/haxe-language-server);
  automatically downloaded from Open VSX, or discovered from the vshaxe VSCode extension)
* **HLSL / GLSL / WGSL**
  (uses [shader-language-server](https://github.com/antaalt/shader-sense) (language `hlsl`); automatically downloaded;
  on macOS, requires Rust toolchain for building from source;
  note: reference search is not supported by this language server)
* **HTML**
  (experimental; requires Node.js + npm)
* **Java**  
* **JavaScript**  
  (supported via the TypeScript language server, i.e. use language `typescript` for both JavaScript and TypeScript)
* **Julia**
* **Kotlin**  
  (uses the pre-alpha [official kotlin LS](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp), some issues may appear)
* **LaTeX**  
  (experimental; must be explicitly enabled via language `latex`; uses [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab),
  auto-downloaded as a SHA-256-verified prebuilt binary; supports `.tex`, `.bib`, `.sty`, and `.cls` files; texlab is
  GPL-3.0 and runs as a separate downloaded process)
* **Lean 4**  
  (requires `lean` and `lake` installed via [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan); uses the built-in Lean 4 LSP;
  the project must be a Lake project with `lake build` run before use)
* **Lua**
* **Luau**
* **Markdown**  
  (must explicitly enable language `markdown`, primarily useful for documentation-heavy projects)
* **MATLAB**  
  (requires Node.js and a licensed local MATLAB installation, R2021b or later; Serena automatically downloads version 1.3.9 of the VS Code MATLAB extension, which bundles the language server)
* **mSL** (mIRC Scripting Language)  
  (auto-installed; no external dependencies required — uses a custom pygls-based LSP server shipped with Serena;
  supports document symbols, workspace symbols, references, and go-to-definition for aliases, events, menus, dialogs, and CTCP handlers in `.mrc` files)
* **Nix**  
  (requires nixd installation)
* **OCaml**
  (requires opam and ocaml-lsp-server to be installed manually; see the [OCaml Setup Guide](../03-special-guides/ocaml_setup_guide_for_serena.md))
* **Pascal**  
  (uses Pascal/Lazarus, which is automatically downloaded; set `PP` and `FPCDIR` environment variables for source navigation)
* **Perl**  
  (requires installation of Perl::LanguageServer)
* **PHP**  
  (by default, uses the Intelephense language server (language `php`), set `INTELEPHENSE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable for premium features;
  we also support [Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor) (language `php_phpactor`), which requires PHP 8.1+;
  and the experimental [PHPantom](https://github.com/PHPantom-dev/phpantom_lsp) backend (language `php_phpantom`)
* **PowerShell**  
  (requires PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) on PATH or in a standard install location; Serena automatically downloads PowerShell Editor Services 4.4.0 and installs PSScriptAnalyzer 1.25.0 via `Save-Module` from your configured PowerShell repository)
* **Python**
  (by default, uses [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) (language `python`);
  alternatives: [BasedPyright](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright) (language `python_basedpyright`),
  [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) (language `python_ty`),
  [pyrefly](https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly) (language `python_pyrefly`),
  [Jedi](https://github.com/palotas/jedi-language-server) (language `python_jedi`);
  Pyright, BasedPyright, ty, and pyrefly require `uv`/`uvx` in PATH)
* **QML**
  (requires Qt 6, provides `qmlls` or `qmlls6` on PATH; see the [Qt qmlls documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-tool-qmlls.html))
* **R**  
  (requires installation of the `languageserver` R package)
* **Rego**  
  (requires the [Regal](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/regal) language server on PATH)
* **Ruby**  
  (by default, uses [ruby-lsp](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) (language `ruby`); use language `ruby_solargraph` to use Solargraph instead.)
* **Rust**  
  (requires [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) - uses rust-analyzer from your toolchain)
* **Scala**  
  (requires some [manual setup](../03-special-guides/scala_setup_guide_for_serena); uses Metals LSP)
* **SCSS / Sass / CSS**
  (experimental; requires Node.js + npm; uses [some-sass-language-server](https://github.com/wkillerud/some-sass) to handle
  `.scss`, `.sass`, and `.css`)
* **Solidity**  
  (experimental; requires Node.js and npm; automatically installs `@nomicfoundation/solidity-language-server`;
  works best with a `foundry.toml` or `hardhat.config.js` in the project root)
* **Svelte**
  (requires Node.js v18+ and npm; supports `.svelte` Single File Components plus TypeScript/JavaScript files via `svelte-language-server`; a companion `typescript-language-server` + `typescript-svelte-plugin` is spawned automatically for cross-file rename, go-to-definition, and references across `.ts`/`.js` and `.svelte` files; use language `svelte` for Svelte projects instead of also enabling `typescript`)
* **Swift**
* **SystemVerilog**  
  (uses `verible-verilog-ls`, taken from PATH if present, otherwise version `v0.0-4051-g9fdb4057` is downloaded automatically)
* **Terraform**  
  (uses `terraform-ls` 0.36.5, which Serena downloads automatically; requires Terraform on PATH)
* **TOML**  
  (experimental; uses Taplo 0.10.0, taken from PATH if present, otherwise downloaded automatically)

* **Vue**    
  (3.x with TypeScript; requires Node.js v18+ and npm; supports .vue Single File Components with monorepo detection)
* **YAML**
* **JSON**  
  (experimental; must be explicitly added to the languages list; requires Node.js and npm)
* **Zig**  
  (requires installation of ZLS - Zig Language Server)

Support for further languages can easily be added by providing a shallow adapter for a new language server implementation,
see Serena's [memory on that](https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/.serena/memories/adding_new_language_support_guide.md).

## The Serena JetBrains Plugin

The [Serena JetBrains Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28946-serena/) leverages the powerful code analysis capabilities of JetBrains IDEs. 
The plugin naturally supports all programming languages and frameworks that are supported by JetBrains IDEs.

When using the plugin, Serena connects to an instance of your JetBrains IDE via the plugin. For users who already
work in a JetBrains IDE, this means Serena seamlessly integrates with the IDE instance you typically have open anyway,
requiring no additional setup or configuration beyond the plugin itself.

* See the [JetBrains Plugin documentation](../02-usage/025_jetbrains_plugin) for a high-level overview of its benefits and usage details.
* See the [Features](025_features) section for a detailed comparison of the capabilities provided by the JetBrains Plugin vs. language servers.
